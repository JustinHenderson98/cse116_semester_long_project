To verify the size of the output. 
view UserInterface line 52, which constructs the model as _model = new mainModel(this,8,2048);
The 3rd argument is the base size of the fractal, which is used in main model which is passed into FractalWorker then finally into generateFractal.
The window can be resized and the UI will scale correctly.

To see this is actually affecting the fractal, the 3rd argument could be lowered to a tiny value like 64 to produce a very pixelated fractal. 
The application will still work like this.
